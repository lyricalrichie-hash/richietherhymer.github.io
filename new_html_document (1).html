Got it — so here’s the deal:

👉 Just adding the HTML file into your repo folder in GitHub Desktop **doesn’t automatically make it live**. You have to **commit** and **push** your changes to GitHub so they show up on GitHub’s servers. Then, GitHub Pages can serve it.

Here’s what you need to do:

1. **In GitHub Desktop:**
   - Make sure your repo is selected.
   - You should see the new/changed HTML file listed under “Changes.”
   - Type a short commit message (like `Added new HTML homepage`).
   - Click **Commit to main** (or master).
   - Then click **Push origin** (this sends it up to GitHub).

2. **Enable GitHub Pages (if not yet):**
   - Go to your repo on GitHub.com.
   - Click **Settings → Pages**.
   - Under “Branch,” select `main` (or master) and `/ (root)`.
   - Save. GitHub will give you a link like: `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo/`

3. **Check the site:**
   - Open that link. Your site should show the video + content.

4. **Connect your GoDaddy domain:**
   - Once you confirm GitHub Pages is live, then we set DNS so RichieTheRhymer.online points to your GitHub Pages site.

⚡ Next step: Do you want me to give you the exact GoDaddy DNS records to point RichieTheRhymer.online to your GitHub Pages once you confirm GitHub Pages is working? 

That way, you’ll go from 404 → live site with video.
